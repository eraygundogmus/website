## How to open a pull request

Make sure your fork repository is synced with remote (upstream, original) repository to avoid conflicts. You can either [check here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) or simply use terminal codes below.
### Syncing a fork branch

First add upstream with:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/frontendship/website
```

Then to get upstream's updates run:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Check out your fork's local default branch:

```bash
git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>
```

Then merge upstream with your fork (local) repo:

```bash
git merge upstream/<BRANCH_NAME>
```

### Example

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fshipcommunity/website
git fetch upstream
git checkout development
git merge upstream/development
```

## Usage/Examples

```javascript
import Header from "../components/Header";

function App() {
  console.log("Hello world");
  return <Header />;
}
```
